- Check status of app and get key details
    https://www.etsy.com/developers/your-apps

====================================

* The Etsy APi requires Node.js (Already installed)

- First I will be using several npm packages for this test. Started by creating a new file in my etsyapp directory called package.json. and pasted the following code in the file and save it.

***************
{
  "name": "etsyapp",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "A simple Node app that makes requests to Etsy’s Open API.",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "4.x",
    "hbs": "^4.1.2",
    "node-fetch": "^2.6.1"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=12 <15"
  },
  "license": "MIT"
}

***************

- then I ran  npm install.
- I then created a file called server.js
   > touch server.js
- vim server.js and pasted a sample code to start a simple web server on port 3003
- then I ran the following command to start the server 
  > node server.js
  * and it worked fine. and printed message "Hello, work!"

========================================

* Next we Test our API key

- updated server.js and updated code to make get request to ping endpoint which does not require authentication scopes — and print the response to the console
- after testing was not able to get the key as my app is still in pending state.
